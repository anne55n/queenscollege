          <h2>About Honor Transfer</h2>
          <p>At its founding in 1937, Queens College was hailed by the people of the borough as “the college of the future.” Now part of the City University of New York (CUNY), Queens College offers a rigorous education in the liberal arts and sciences under the guidance of a faculty dedicated to both teaching and research. Students graduate with the ability to think critically, address complex problems, explore various cultures, and use modern technologies and information resources.</p>

The college boasts state-of-the-art computer and science laboratories, a spectacular music building, and the six-story Rosenthal Library. The major classroom building, Powdermaker Hall, has the latest technology throughout. An extensive commitment to sustainability has earned Queens College inclusion in the Princeton Review’s first-ever Guide to 322 Green Colleges.</p>
